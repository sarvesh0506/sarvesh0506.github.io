## 📦 Deployment to GitHub Pages

The project contains a pre-configured `gh-pages` deployment pipeline. To publish your portfolio to GitHub Pages:

Run the deploy command:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
1. Automatically compile the production bundle (`predeploy` script running `npm run build`).
2. Scaffolds the build assets inside the `dist/` directory.
3. Automatically pushes the output assets to the `gh-pages` branch on your remote repository.

Ensure that the repository settings on GitHub are configured to serve pages from the `gh-pages` branch.
